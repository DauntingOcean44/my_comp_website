        <p>
          Expect to find a navigation menu at the top that leads to four other
          pages. An about me page, which will contain information about my
          computer science background and coding experience. An ICS3U page,
          filled to the brim with what I've learned from my computer science
          class. A game page, decked from top to bottom with all things Sewer
          Rat Game related. Finally, there is the web dev page, complete with
          everything I believe an aspiring programmer would need to learn to
          become an expert web developer.
