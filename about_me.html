        <h1>My computer backstory</h1>
        <p>
          My hobbies include programming, gaming, working out, and reading. In
          particular I like programming in Javascript and Typescript. I'm
          currently trying to learn the Angular framework in hopes of making an
          io game. Might switch to Phaser, however, since it is a dedicated game
          development platform. I've been programming ever since I was a little
          kid, with my first programming languages being Scratch and Minecraft.
          I've sinced moved on to more advanced languages like Javascript, but I
          still occasionally program in Minecraft. Besides my personal
          experience, a lot of my programming ability comes from all the
          computer science classes I took. Some notable concepts that I've
          learnt are looping through lists, function declaration, math
          operations, and importing dependancies.
